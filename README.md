# PyFORC

FORC analysis in Python. PyFORC has been developed with multithreaded GUI support from the beginning, making it fast and easy to use.

## Installation

Install by cloning this repo and running

`python main.py`

to bring up the GUI. In the future I might put this on PyPi, but the project is still in its infancy.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome - open an issue or create a pull request. I'm trying to stick to PEP8 as much as I can, except I'm using line lengths of 120 characters. I'm using numpydoc formatting for the documentation as well. Don't worry too much about this stuff though, we can work together to integrate your code.
