## Contributions

Contributions are welcome - open an issue or create a pull request. I'm trying to stick to PEP8 as much as I can, except I'm using line lengths of 120 characters. I'm using numpydoc formatting for the documentation as well. Don't worry too much about this stuff though, we can work together to integrate your code.
