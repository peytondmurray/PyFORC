FORC analysis in Python.

Install by cloning this repo and running

`pip install .`

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome - open an issue or create a pull request. I'm trying
to stick to PEP8 as much as I can, except I'm using line lengths of 100
characters. I'm using numpydoc formatting for the documentation as well. Don't
worry too much about this stuff though, we can work together to integrate your
code.
